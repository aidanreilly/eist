[Send us an email](mailto:eistcork@gmail.com?subject=I'd%20like%20to%20subscribe%20to%20occasional%20emails%20from%20Ã‰ist&body=Thanks! "Subscribe for news about Ã‰ist and upcoming events") if you would like to receive occasional updates about news and upcoming events.

Running an independent radio station is not cheap.
We rely completely on the good will and support of our members and listeners.

If you like what you hear, and you want us to keep broadcasting, please consider setting up a monthly **â‚¬5** PayPal subscription. 
Your money goes directly towards the costs of running the radio station, helping us to pay for rent, electricity, radio web hosting, studio kit, etc.
Your help and support for Ã‰ist is vital and greatly appreciated - we can't do this alone.

Thank you! ðŸ¤Ÿ
