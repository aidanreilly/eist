### Support us with a monthly subscription of just â‚¬5

Your money goes directly towards the costs of running the radio station, helping us to pay for rent, electricity, radio web hosting, studio kit, etc.
Your help and support for Ã‰ist is vital and greatly appreciated - we can't do this alone.

Thank you! ðŸ¤Ÿ
