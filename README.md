# Éist radio

Hacking a website together one kludge at a time. 

# Getting started

Install Hugo: https://gohugo.io/installation/

# Adding content and building docs

Add a new markdown file with a TOML format header into the content/ folder:

```markdown
+++
title = "The title!"
date = 2024-11-19T20:23:18Z
draft = false
+++

Start typing...

```

# Checking your build locally

```cmd
$ hugo server
```

# Deploying previews with Surge

PR previews are live at `https://overt-stop.surge.sh`. You might need to modify `.github/workflows/preview.yml` ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
